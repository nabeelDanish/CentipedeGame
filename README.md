# CentipedeGame
Classic Centipede Game coded using OpenGL and GLUT

## Installation
The project files are from Visual Studio Community 2019. It requires OpenGL and GLUT libraries. Follow this tutorial : https://www.absingh.com/opengl/ to ensure you have GLUT installed

## About
The game is a homage to the classic Atari Centipede (TM). You can check out the original game here: https://my.ign.com/atari/centipede. I tried to imitate the artsyle and game mechanics to the original as close as possible. 

The code uses a lot of OOP. The sprites and animations are hard coded frame by frame, and the animation is done by keyframing between them using interval. The collision is done using a 2D Grid that tracks and stores all objects in the game.  

## To Play
Use the arrow keys to move your character and space to fire.
